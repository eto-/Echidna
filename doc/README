Borexino experiment.
Echidna project.
Official documentation.

This directory can be compiled with the perl script "pmake".
Its use is very similar to standard make.

1) To produce dvi file:
 $ pmake (dvi)

2) To produce dvi file and view it with xdvi:
 $ pmake x

3) To produce ps/pdf file
 $ pmake ps
 $ pmake pdf

4) To produce html directory
 $ pmake html

5) To clean up
 $ pmake clean

pmake handles automatically the eventuality to run latex twice 
to get cross-references right. 
If, however, further compilation is required it can be forced with:

 $ pmake f



FIGURES:
Directory "pictures" should contain directly only "eps" files.
If you add a figure with xfig, please put ONLY the ".fig" file in 
"pictures/xfig". 
The relative eps file will generated automatically by pmake upon compilation.
