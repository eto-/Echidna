A. event external support for dst:
    1) added support for MOE in dst (Mach4 event)
    2) added support for FWFD in dst 

B. muon tracking
    1) new module (bx_laben_tof_tracker) and new BxLaben::BxTrackByPoints.
    2) Global tracker: prefer tof tracking.
    3) In class BxTrackByPoints, Impact, theta and phi are hold as variables instead of calculated by getters. Errors have been also introduced on these 3 variables.
    4) support for EMT, not yet operative in this release.

C. diverses
    1) new laben raw hit flag for the special hit introduced with the laben firmware modification and nhits_fw counter variable.
    2) clustered_hits_bkg filled also for tt1 events using the time before the cluster (up to Feb 2nd. 2010, not available later)
    3)  increased out-of-gate window up to 30us   
    4) splitting: min 10 hits required

D. BUG FIXES
    1) empty boards calculation:
    1.1) in case the run number is later then cr14 removal its 20 boards are
not counted any longer (they were sistematically marked as empty in
c12)
    1.2) there was a bug in the way the channels were group, a -1 shift. In
other words we were not counting empty boards but grops of 8 empty
adiacent channels 7 of wich belonging to 1 board and the 8th belonging
to the next one. fixed.
    1.3) Special hits (1/ch, see point C.1 above) with the information of the number of hits in the
channel  are present in data since Feb 2nd 2010. In c12 they counted
against empty boards setting the variable systematically to 0 after Feb 2010. fixed.
   2) n live charge calculation, bug fixed
   3) rec_time filling in decoded hits: fixed the bug on cluster vector alignment.
   4) old ID tracking: fixed the bug on non-filling of exit point.
   5) reader: Fixed directory naming in storage

E. Internals
   1) Change for new streamer and rootcint in channel_description_type_map
