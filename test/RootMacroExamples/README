===================================================================
This directory contains some examples of root macros that performs 
simple and usual operations on the Borexino Echidna root file.

Each macro is reasonably commented, therefore this document gives
just a very brief description of each one

To run a macro, you have to perform the following operations:

root
.L libechidna.so
.L macroname.C
macroname(optional parameters depending on macro)

1. PlotExample1.C
	Simple plot of the trigger type

2. PlotExample2.C
   	Simple plot of the difference between geneb energy and reconstructed 
	nominal energy defined as number of pmts / 300.
	To be used with Geneb montecarlo data only!
